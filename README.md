## 🎯 Overview

The Education Examination & Evaluation Process Explainer Bot is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based chatbot designed to help students understand complex examination and evaluation processes. By uploading institutional PDF documents, students can ask questions and receive accurate, document-grounded answers about:

- Examination patterns and schedules
- Grading systems (CGPA, GPA, letter grades)
- Revaluation and recounting processes
- Supplementary and improvement examinations
- Attendance rules and eligibility criteria
- Hall ticket and registration procedures
- Result publication and transcript processes

### 🎯 Key Highlights

- **Document-Grounded Responses**: Answers are strictly based on uploaded documents
