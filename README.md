> A student-friendly AI assistant that explains academic examination and evaluation processes using your institution's official documents.

## What It Does

Upload your exam regulation PDFs and ask questions in plain language. The bot retrieves the exact relevant sections from your documents and explains them clearly — covering grading systems, revaluation, supplementary exams, attendance rules, and more.

**What it will NOT do:** predict grades, solve exam questions, or provide model answers.
